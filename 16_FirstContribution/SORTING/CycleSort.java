//What is Cycle sort 
//When we are given numbers from 1 to N (not necessarily exactly from 1 to N) we use cycle sort.
//It sorts the entire array in one single pass.
//The basic idea behind cycle sort is the sorted array will contain elements on their correct index.
//For eg. - elements from 1 to 5 will be on index 0 to 4 in the sorted array.
//Advantages are :- It sorts the array in-place and does not require additional memory for temporary variables.
